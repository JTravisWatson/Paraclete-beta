## I. Introduction
- Definition of integrity
- Importance of integrity in the Christian life

Integrity is a fundamental trait that every Christian must possess in their daily life. It is the quality of being honest, truthful, and having strong moral principles. As followers of Christ, we are called to live a life of integrity and be an example to others around us.

The Bible teaches us that integrity is essential in our relationship with God and others. In Proverbs 11:3, it says "The integrity of the upright guides them but the unfaithful are destroyed by their duplicity." This verse reminds us that living a life of integrity will guide us towards righteousness and protect us from destruction caused by deceitfulness.

Furthermore, Jesus himself set an example of living a life full of integrity. He always spoke the truth regardless of the consequences and remained faithful to his mission despite facing many challenges. As Christians, we should strive to follow his example by being truthful in all aspects of our lives.

Living with integrity also means upholding ethical standards in our personal and professional lives. We must maintain honesty in all our dealings with people around us, whether it be family members or colleagues at work. Integrity enables us to build trust with others which ultimately leads to stronger relationships.

In conclusion, as Christians, we are called to live a life that reflects the character of Christ by exhibiting honesty and strong moral principles in everything that we do. By doing so, we can be an example to those around us and bring glory to God through our actions.

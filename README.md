# Welcome to the Paraclete Beta Vault
Hello and welcome to the Paraclete Beta Vault! Thank you for downloading this vault to check out the Paraclete System. I hope you find this vault (and the system) to be incredibly helpful.

The point of this project is to create a set of standards and a workflow to help Bible Teachers create lessons with greater efficiency and richness. The Paraclete System leverages the inherent power in [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md) as a note making and connecting application to make this happen.

## How this vault Works
This vault is a pretty opinionated "preset" of a possible Paraclete Vault. All that that means is that I have made some choices about how to set this up. Those choices where mostly in the way of a [[Beta Vault Demo Structure|Folder Structure.]] Those choices can of course be entirely ignored, or undone if you so choose. 

After you are comfortable with the Paraclete System, you can delete this folder `+ Start Here`, and start fresh with a clean vault.

## How to use it
This particular Beta Vault is pre-populated with a few notes, plug-in, and folders for you to experiment with. Feel free to link, edit, destroy, and create to your heartâ€™s content. Get a feel for the vault, and workflow.

There are a couple main options here. This is either your first Obsidian Vault, or you are an experienced Obsidian user. Either way, the best way to use this Vault is to start using it. I recommend to start with a lesson, and a reflection/study note of some sort. See how they connect, how it can help you, and then go from there.

# What is the Paraclete system?
The Paraclete System is a framework of naming standards and workflow within Obsidian, and is meant to be a tool to help Bible teachers, Pastors, and Small Group teachers to enable them produce more focused, enriched, and consistent lessons. The system leverages the program [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md), along with a couple of its plug-ins in order to make this tool as powerful as possible.
**The Paraclete System has multiple parts.**
1. The set of naming standards
2. The overarching workflow

Paraclete can be used as either just `1`, or as `1 & 2`. 

For a much more detailed explainaition of the PARAclete System and the workflow, see the [[Project Overview]].

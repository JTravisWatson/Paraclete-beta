# Books of the Bible
These pages should *not* be confused with the folders/notes with the *contents* of the Biblical books if you are using the `Bible in Obsidian` expansion.

These pages should act as a home dashboard for each individual book. Personally, I exclude the  `Scripture` folder from my graph view. Using a note as a hub for each book allows me to still see and track various connections as well as tack notes, summarize, and otherwise compile thoughts without modifying the scripture notes.

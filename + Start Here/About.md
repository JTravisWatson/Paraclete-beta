## Just a dude who reads the Bible and does what it says.

Hi there, I'm Travis!

Everybody is a nerd about something, and I just happen to be a nerd about a lot of things. Star Wars, computers, music, but most importantly, I'm a nerd about Jesus. I love using Obsidian, and I love reading Scripture, discipling people, and teaching Scripture. I created this project hoping it might help people teach the Word and to teach it well.

Let's see where this goes!

# This Vault, and Project, is in Beta
So, what does that mean?

This is in the early stages of being shared with others, so there are bound to be plenty of rough spots that need some polish. This might include incomplete pages and concepts.

## Testing
If you are reading this, than first of all, thank you for your interest in my project, and secondly, I need your feedback. I encourage you to experiment with what’s here, push it and mold it to fit your needs.

Try using Paraclete to create and give a handful of lessons. Feel free to change what you feel needs to be changed (without changing the standards like the root folder system or the variable names), and find what works and possibly what doesn’t.

## Feedback
Do you have a workflow that could fit in the core of the system? Have you found something that just **does not** serve its intended purpose? Do you have a better idea for a name of a variable of folder? 

I want to hear it all. 

## The project
I am also open to any and all suggestions for how to help this project grow. My main goal is to cultivate a community or a space where users can freely search, discover, and share Paraclete Notes. If you have any ideas on how to move this forward (out of beta and beyond), I would love to hear them.

You can find my contact info on the [[About]] page.

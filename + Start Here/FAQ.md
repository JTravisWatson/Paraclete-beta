# Frequently Asked Questions

## Who is the Paraclete System for, exactly?
I imagine this system would benefit different people differently.

First off, anyone who teaches can benefit from the focused workflow to produce enriched lessons with linked thinking to other lessons previously taught.

Secondly, I imagine the aspects around personal connections with members, would benefit Small Group Leaders and Pastors of smaller congregations. It would be unreasonable to keep a detailed personal database on 5k people, but 50 isn‘t such a stretch.

## What if I'm already comfortable with my workflow/file structure?
That's great. Remember, the Paraclete System can be used as simply the metadata and naming conventions. This will still allow you to share notes with the community and mutually benefit.

## Do I have to use Obsidian? Couldn't I just use this with Roam/Craft/Evernote?
Maybe, maybe not. But probably not. The dataview plug-in is such a large part of the benefit of this system, that migrating just the tag names and file structure to another program might have minimal benefits. With Obsidian being free, personal, encrypted, and extensible, I see no reason not to use it.

## Who are you and why are you in over your head?
Good question. I'm a Christian who loves to teach, disciple, and proclaim. I had this idea for my personal setup, and thought "why not expand this to benefit more people?" I am definitely trying to hit above my weight class here, and if you know how and want to help, feel free to reach out.

## Why is this Vault such a mess?
This whole thing is a work in progress. The standards, the site, the whole enchilada. If you are using this vault, than I am looking for your feedback!

## I don’t like your folder structure!!
First off, that’s not a question. Secondly, only the folders numbered 1,2,3,4 on the root are needed for the Paraclete System. Since the standard for Paraclete [[dataview]] queries is to never get more specific than `FROM “3 Archives”` or `FROM “1 Lessons”`, what you do inside of those is between you and Jesus. It makes no difference to the system. You can of course create your own dataview queries that make more specific calls, but those we ask not be shared since they would not conform to our system standards and therefore not work as intended in another users vault.

# Expansions
These are just a few modules that greatly increase whatâ€™s available to you in the Paraclete System.

## The Bible in Markdown
Not really a plug-in, and not really required, but the [Bible in Markdown](https://github.com/selfire1/BibleGateway-to-Obsidian) is incredibly useful. This is a bit more advanced, and requires some time in the command line, but the pay-off is huge. This script turns the entire Bible into a folder that can live in your vault. This allows links, and quotes all within your vault. Again, not required, but a real game changer.

## Database Folder
[`Database Folder`](obsidian://show-plugin?id=dbfolder) is a huge plug-in that makes Obsidian feel like a whole new program. This essentially allows you to turn a folder into a Notion-like database. You can create new entries, modify metadata, search, and sort all from the database view. This is the basis for the Member Database on my personal iteration of this system. What this can do is far beyond the scope of this write up.
